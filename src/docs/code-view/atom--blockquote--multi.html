<blockquote>
  <p>Buying land is the most competitive part of house building, but once it&#x27;s bought there are few incentives to build quickly. To make back the money they&#x27;ve spent buying a site, it often makes sense for developers to draw out building when house prices are rising, and to stop and wait it out when prices fall. If we&#x27;re going to build the homes we need, this has to change. </p>
